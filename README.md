# Full-Stack eCommerce Project: flask-wineshop
## Objective
To create my first eCommerce website, I made two applications: 
the web app—flask-wineshop—that produces the eCommerce website and the web scraper—
[python-wine-scraper](https://github.com/eriklolson/python-wine-scraper)—that supplies the back-end database with mock
wine products. Although a wine merchant has unique product offerings, there are functionalities that are common to many 
eCommerce websites. This includes:

Public Users
* View products
* Flash messages for user feedback
* Filter products by categories

Logged-in Users
* Shopping Cart
* Commit orders
* View order history
* View account info page

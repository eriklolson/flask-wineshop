# Full-Stack E-commerce Project

## Objectives
My goal was to make a full e-commerce website.  To accomplish this, I created a wine merchant website. Although a wine merchant has unique product offerings, there are functionalities that are common to many e-commerce webites. These include the following:

Public Users
* View products
* Flash messages for user feedback
* Filter products by categories

Logged-in Users
* Add and remove products to shopping cart
* Update quantity of product(s) in cart
* Place orders via checkout
* View order history
* View user profile

### Technologies Used Include:
* Python
* Flask
* Jinja2
* HTML
* SCSS
* TailwindCSS
* Anaconda Project
* AlpineJS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Postgres
* SQLAlchemy
* WTForms & Flask_wtf
* Redis
* Flask-Migrate
* marshmallow & marshmallow_jsonapi
* werkzeug.security
* Flask-Login
* Flask-paginate
* Flask-REST-JSONAPI

## Directions
These instructions assume anaconda (or miniconda) is installed. Install anaconda-project if not already installed with 'conda install anaconda-project'. Then install app dependencies and create environment by running the command 'anaconda-project run'. This same command is also used to run the app on localhost.
